# Description

Gaussian processes are flexible probabilistic models that can be used to perform regression analysis without having to provide pre-specified functional relationships between the variables.

# Project Motivation

This project is a part of Udacity's Data Scientit Nanodegree Course. 
I've developed a python package which is used for analyzing both gaussian and binomial distributions.

Purpose of package:

1. Read a dataset
2. Calculate mean
3. Calculate standard deviation
4. Plot histogram
5. Plot propability density function
6. Add two distributions together

The main goal of this assignment is to develop an object-oriented programming skills with python, including:

1. Procedural vs Object-oriented Programming
2. Classes, Objects, Methods, and Attributes
3. Coding a class
4. Magic methods
5. Inheritance

# Installation

To install the package, simply run the below command
`pip install nd-probability`

# Files

Here is a description of each
- The distributions package includes Binomialdistribution.py, Gaussiandistribution.py and Generaldistribution.py code
- setup.cfg file contains setup script
- README.md file contains the information about package
- license.txt file contains the licensing information
